    "# Language models\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are generative models that write text as us (humans) would do it.\n",
    "Current advances in language modeling, such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), are definitely on par with humans (honestly, we set the bar quite low).\n",

    "The most common approach to generate sequential data, is to recursively predict the following item. In the case of language modeling, we could take a piece of text as starting point and use our model to predict the next word. Appending the predicted word to the existing text, and feeding it to the model again, we could predict the following word. Following this procedure, we could write any arbitrary amount of text!\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "While the procedure may seem simple, language is very complex and writing coherent text is quite a challenge. Even though we may write text sequentially, the relationships between elements within the text can be intrincate with forward and backwards dependencies that can be an entire book apart.\n",
    ":::\n",

    "## Giving numerical meaning to text\n",
    "\n",
    "We can communicate very deep concepts with words, but how does a machine *understand* them?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with text, we split it into elementary pieces called **tokens**. This is known as tokenization and there is quite a lot of freedom on how to do it. For example, we can take from full sentences, to words, to single characters. The most common practice is to use sub-word tokens that are between single characters to full words, such as [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). We can also have special tokens to account for additional grammatical information. For example, we can use special tokens to indicate the beggining and ending of a sequence, or to indicate that the words start with capital letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see a simple tokenization example. We would take the following sentence:\n",
    "```\n",
    "My cat won't stop purring.\n",
    "```\n",
    "And transform it into the tokens:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<BoS><x_maj><my> <cat> <wo><n't> <stop> <purr><ing><.><EoS>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "I just made up this tokenization, this is just to provide an idea.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we define a *vocabulary* of tokens. To provide them with \"meaning\", we assign a trainable parameter vector to each of them, which are known as **embedding vectors**. The larger the embedding, the richer the information we can associate to every individual token. We typically store these vectors in a so-called **embedding matrix**, where every row provides the associated embedding vector to a token. This way, we identify the tokens by an integer index that corresponds to their row in the embedding matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking long tokens results into large vocabularies and, therefore, we need more memory. However, we can generate a piece of text with just a few inference steps. Conversely, short tokens require much less memory at the cost of more inference steps to write. Thus, this presents a trade-off between memory and computational time. You can get some intuition about it by comparing the number of letters in the alphabet (shortest possible tokens) with the number of entries in a dictionary (every word is a token).\n",
    "\n",
    "To process a piece of text, we first split it into the tokens of our vocabulary (tokenization), and replace the tokens by their corresponding indices (numericalization). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in our example task. First of all, we build the token vocabulary. In this simple case, every digit is a token together with the separator \",\". "

We model text as a sequence of tokens $\\mathbf{x}=\\left[x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{T-1}\\right]$, and the goal is to predict the next token $x_T$. This way, we can recursively generate text: \n",

As such, we wish to minimize the negative log-likelihood loss or cross-entropy loss:\n",
