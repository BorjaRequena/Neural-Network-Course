    "In this homework we will have two main tasks: a regression and a classification. However, your first goal will be to actually design each of these by choosing an appropiate problem and dataset.\n",

    "You have complete freedom to choose any dataset that you may wish to work with, from some personal project to any random dataset in the internet, as long as it allows you to perform the tasks below (read them first!). We encourage you to choose a problem that you may find interesting or that you have any curiosity about the topic. We recommend [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), although you can also download data from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) or, simply, do a google search.\n",

    "\n",
    "After the first preliminary analysis, we can proceed based on the previous results. We propose two possible directions but **one is enough**. Also, if you find anything interesting that you would like to explore instead of the following options, feel free to do it and report it.\n",
