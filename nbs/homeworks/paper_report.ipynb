    "The goal of this task is to get used to reading and understanding scientific papers. You will find that the best papers tend to have a clear message, making it easy to understand the motivation and the novelty of the presented work. Thus, the task consists of reading a paper about a relevant topic for the course and writing a report (max 2 pages) explaining it (see the guidelines below). \n",
